<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I am a graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Statistics, with practical experience in data analysis,

decision-making.

I have contributed to national-level research projects within government institutions, supporting the design and
implementation of surveys, data management, statistical analysis, and preparation of research reports and
publications. I am particularly motivated by research and analytical work that informs public policy, improves
development outcomes, and strengthens institutional planning and accountability.
