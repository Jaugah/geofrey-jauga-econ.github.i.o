<h1>Geofrey Okoth Jauga</h1>
<p><strong>Economist | Data Analyst | Research & Policy Assistant</strong></p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I am a graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Statistics, with practical experience in data analysis,
survey research, and policy-oriented studies. My academic training and professional experience have equipped me
with strong competencies in data collection, cleaning, analysis, and interpretation to support evidence-based
decision-making.
</p>

<p>
I have contributed to national-level research projects within government institutions, supporting the design and
implementation of surveys, data management, statistical analysis, and preparation of research reports and
publications. I am particularly motivated by research and analytical work that informs public policy, improves
development outcomes, and strengthens institutional planning and accountability.
</p>

<p>
My career goal is to develop as a data analyst, economist, and research professional within government,
development organizations, or academic research environments, while pursuing postgraduate studies through
competitive Master’s degree scholarship programs.
